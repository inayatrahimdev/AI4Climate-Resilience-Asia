# AI4Climate-Resilience-Asia

**AI4Climate-Resilience-Asia** is an open, research-grade framework designed to support climate adaptation and sustainability efforts in vulnerable rural communities across Asia. This system leverages high-resolution satellite data and deep geospatial learning techniques to detect agricultural stress, predict flooding events, and monitor water resource patterns. It is aligned with the innovation goals of the Asian Development Bank and its development partners.

## Project Scope

This project targets high-impact use cases in agricultural monitoring, hydrological risk assessment, and rural water planning. It aims to enable researchers, NGOs, policymakers, and local communities to detect and mitigate climate-related risks using open AI infrastructure.

---

## Capabilities

- Detection of **crop stress zones** from satellite and aerial imagery  
- **Seasonal and event-driven flood risk identification**  
- Monitoring and mapping of **reservoirs, wells, and water bodies** over time  
- Remote sensing–based classification of **soil moisture, vegetation loss, and degradation**  
- Support for temporal change detection and cross-season analysis  
- Lightweight deployment for **rural access (offline inference)**  

---

## Technology Stack

- **Core Deep Learning Framework**: [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle)  
- **Segmentation Toolkit**: [PaddleSeg](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg)  
- **Geospatial Data Tools**: RasterIO, GDAL, xarray, EarthPy  
- **Temporal Analytics**: NumPy, pandas, SciPy  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh  
- **Model Deployment (Optional)**: Paddle Lite, FastDeploy  
- **Data Sources**: ESA Sentinel-2, NASA Landsat 8/9, MODIS, CHIRPS, Google Earth Engine Export

---

## Datasets

- **Sentinel-2 Multispectral Data (ESA)**  
  High-res optical imagery for vegetation health, water mapping, and land classification.

- **Landsat 8/9 Surface Reflectance**  
  Moderate-res imagery useful for seasonal change detection and water dynamics.

- **CHIRPS Precipitation Time Series**  
  Satellite-based rainfall estimates for correlation with flood and drought events.

- **Field Sample Labeling (Optional)**  
  Manual drone or field GPS samples for supervised fine-tuning.

---

## Use Cases

- **Food Security Monitoring** (early crop failure zones, drought stress)  
- **Flood Zone Mapping** (before and after inundation over temporal windows)  
- **Water Resource Planning** (detect loss or silting in reservoirs and irrigation networks)  
- **Soil Degradation Tracking** (progressive desertification or nutrient loss)  
- **Policy Planning and Risk Zoning for NGOs and Governments**

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI4Climate-Resilience-Asia.git
cd AI4Climate-Resilience-Asia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Quick Start

1. Download Sentinel-2 or Landsat TIFF files and place them in `data/raw/`
2. Configure segmentation model for vegetation stress:

```bash
python src/segmentation/infer_stress_map.py --image data/raw/scene.tif
```

3. Predict flood zones using CHIRPS rainfall anomaly + NDWI:

```bash
python src/flood_forecast/predict_flood_risk.py --region data/raw/flood_area_2023.tif
```

4. Visualize water loss in reservoir:

```bash
python src/visualization/compare_years.py --before 2021.tif --after 2024.tif
```

## Real-World Alignment

This project was inspired by the “**AI for Climate Resilience**” challenge launched by the **Asian Development Bank (ADB)** in partnership with:

* **IFAD** (International Fund for Agricultural Development)
* **CGIAR** (Global Agricultural Research Network)
* **World Bank Climate Resilience Program**
* **UN World Food Programme (WFP)**

It is intended for practical impact across rural Asia, with community-driven, ethical, and interpretable AI deployment in focus.
